MIPS Instruction Types

R-type (Arithmetic instructions)
  Format: op (6 bits), rs (5 bits), rt (5 bits), rd (5 bits), shamt (5 bits), funct (6 bits)
  Used for arithmetic and logical instructions.

I-type (Transfer, branch, immediate instructions)
  Format: op (6 bits), rs (5 bits), rt (5 bits), address/immediate (16 bits)
  Used for transfer, branch, and immediate operations.

J-type (Jump instructions)
  Format: op (6 bits), target address (26 bits)
  Used for jump instructions.

Field Descriptions
  Op[31–26]: 6-bit operation code
  RS[25–21]: 5-bit source register specifier
  RT[20–16]: 5-bit target (source or destination) register or branch condition
  Immediate[15–0]: 16-bit immediate value, branch displacement, or address displacement
  Target[25–0]: 26-bit jump target address
  RD[15–11]: 5-bit destination register specifier
  Shamt[10–6]: 5-bit shift amount
  Funct[5–0]: 6-bit function field
